# Arkham_Project
Analyzing sentiments in songs chosen by pacients from a brazilian asylum. 

Here we aim to use NLP analysis to evaluate sentiments in songs (by using libraries 'Vader' and 'Spacy') and also check possible connections between the songs chosen by the interns in the asylum, their symptoms (related with drug abuse, abstinence, addiction,  autism or insanity) and the treatment received.
