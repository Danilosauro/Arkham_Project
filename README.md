Analyzing sentiments in songs chosen by pacients from a brazilian asylum. 

The main purpose of this analysis is to evaluate sentiments in songs by using libraries 'Vader' and 'Spacy' and also evalute possible connections between the songs chosen by the interns in the asylum and their symptoms related with drug abuse, abstinence, autism or insanity.
